    <h2><p>Like broccoli cheddar soup meets risotto, but easier, and quicker to make.</p></h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>Olive Oil</li>
       <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
       <li>Chicken Breast</li>
       <li>Onion</li>
       <li>Butter</li>
       <li>Basmati Rice</li>
       <li>Chicken Broth</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, set over medium heat, combine the olive oil, chicken, and onion. Cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the butter, thyme, garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne. Mix in the rice and pasta, cook until golden and toasted, 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli and a large pinch each of salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce the heat to low. Cook, covered for 20-25 minutes, until the rice is mostly cooked.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, stir in the milk. Add the cheese, then remove from the heat. Stir until creamy. Serve warm with additional thyme and black pepper.</li>
